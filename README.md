Electricity Billing System Project
This is a README file for an Electricity Billing System project implemented using Java and a Graphical User Interface (GUI).

Project Overview
The Electricity Billing System is designed to automate the process of calculating and generating electricity bills for customers. It provides a user-friendly interface that allows users to input meter readings, calculate the bill amount, and generate invoices.

The project is implemented in Java programming language and utilizes GUI components to create an interactive interface for users.

Features
User registration: Allows new customers to register their details in the system.
Meter reading entry: Users can input their monthly meter readings.
Bill calculation: The system calculates the bill amount based on the meter readings and other parameters.
Bill generation: Generates an invoice with detailed billing information.
Payment tracking: Keeps track of payments made by customers.
Customer information management: Allows users to update customer details, view bill history, and perform other administrative tasks.
Prerequisites
To run the Electricity Billing System project, make sure you have the following software installed:

Java Development Kit (JDK): Version 8 or higher.
Integrated Development Environment (IDE): Any Java-compatible IDE such as Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA, or NetBeans.
Getting Started
Clone the project repository to your local machine or download the source code as a ZIP file.
shell
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/lrkaushal/Electricity_billing_system.github.io.git
Open your preferred Java IDE and import the project.

Build the project to ensure that all dependencies are resolved correctly.

Run the application and the GUI interface should appear.

Project Structure
The project structure is organized as follows:

src: Contains the source code files.
com.electricitybilling: Root package.
model: Contains classes representing the data models.
dao: Data access object classes for interacting with the database or file system.
service: Service classes for business logic implementation.
